# Math Adventure Game üéÆüìö

An educational 3D game built with Unity and C++ aimed at 4th‚Äì6th grade students to enhance their math skills through interactive gameplay.

## üß† Concept
The game teaches math concepts like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using **shapes and exploration mechanics**. Each level is designed to align with a semester of the school year, and includes themed sublevels to maintain variety and engagement.

### Example Gameplay:
- **Level 1**: The player sees a big **cube** (6 sides). The goal is to find **6 hidden items**.
- **Level 2**: A **rectangle (4 sides)** + a **cube (8 sides)** appear. The player must collect **12 items** (4+8).
- Later levels introduce **multiplication and division**, increasing difficulty in a fun, logical way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- **4 Main Levels**, each with **4 Themed Sublevels**
- Progressive math difficulty: addition ‚û° subtraction ‚û° multiplication ‚û° division
- Visual counters (e.g., basket icon) to track progress
- Asset size optimization (no asset over 30MB to keep performance smooth)
- Designed for children with an intuitive and friendly interface

## üë©‚Äçüíª Tech Stack
- **C++**
- **Unity Engine**
- Custom game logic, basic physics, and UI mechanics

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Add voice-over math questions to support auditory learners
- Improve asset design and optimization
